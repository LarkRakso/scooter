# scooter
A simple and cheap propeller driven vehicle based on arduino, aluminum profiles and quad copter spare parts.

The sw uses this library for ESC control: https://github.com/RB-ENantel/RC_ESC/
It is also described here: https://www.robotshop.com/blog/en/rc-speed-controller-esc-arduino-library-20470

For reading the remote control receiver, the code and method described here is the base:https://ryanboland.com/blog/reading-rc-receiver-values/. That method uses the EnableInterrupt library found at https://github.com/GreyGnome/EnableInterrupt.
